# Helix - sections

Sample project to illustrate how sections work

---

## A first section - text only

This is a section with text only. Just one simple paragraph.
Odd sections have a grey background while even sections have a blue background.

---

## Second section - text and image

This is a paragraph that is illustrated with the image above.

## Third section - another text and image

This is another paragraph and image section, can we differentiate the rendering ?

## Fourth section - title and list only

* Sections with a list are special, they deserve a red background
* Explain something
* Explain something else
* Finally the section may be rendered differently

---

* List only, no title = carousel
* Carousel item 2
* Carousel item 3
* Carousel item 4
